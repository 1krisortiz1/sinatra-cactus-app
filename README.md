Sinatra Cactus App
This is a CRUD, MVS application that uses Sinatra tracking cactus. The application gives users the ability to log and track cactus that they may be encountering for the first time.  The application allows users to login, signup, and logout.  A user can also create a cactus entry, see all entries, see their show page, and edit and delete only their entries.
